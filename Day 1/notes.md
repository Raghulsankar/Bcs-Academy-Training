> - landing pages is an example of website

### Native Application

.com - Refers TLDR

html, css, javascript load in the server - hositing

#### notes

> 3handshake

Example - Insta Live , Youtube Live , ONLINE GAMES,

### Four type of IP Adress

1. Public
2. Private
3. static
4. dynamic

MAC ADDRESS - WILL NOT CHANGE INCASE CHANGE NETWORK ADAPTER THEN IT WILL CHANGE

> What are the advantages of Http 3 ?

## tech stack

### Internet

> What is internet?
> Punch of intranet are called as 'Internet'

> What is Topology?

[http2](http://www.http2demo.io/)

### Http 2
