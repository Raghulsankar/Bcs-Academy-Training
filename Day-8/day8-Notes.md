# Scope in javascript

> - lifetime of variable or boundry
>   from what start what from

# Types of scopes (4 types)

1. Block scope
2. function scope
3. lexical scope - day9 notes will be added

- {} - creates blockscope
- fun(){} creates a functionscope.

- let,const uses only inside the block
- you cant contain 'VAR' inside the block
- let and const is an Block scope
- var is an function scope
- function scope doesn,t escape var

# Types if Functions

2.

// Types of functions

- 1. function declaration
- 2.  function expression
- 3. Arrow function
- 4. IIFF
- 5. Anonymous - function doesn't have name is called 'anonoymous function'

## normal function vs arrow function difference

> arrow functions (this Keyword)

# Loops in Javascript

> DRY - Dont Repeat Again

- loops are needed when we want to repeat statements. that is the motivation of loops.

### How do you loops works?

- for() contain three parts
- 1. initialization
- 2.condition
- increment or decrement part (updation)

> syntax

for(1.initialization ; 2. condition; updation){
//repeating statements
}

> only one time check initialize section

## Types of loops

1. for...loop
2. while...loop
3. do...while

> same cycle only the way of writing is difference.
